## An example of a very simple sales forecasting model developed in the MS .Net framework languages.
### A simple demonstration model for generating sales forecasts of hybrid and electric vehicles. The demosales package is an open-source SyncroSim Base Package.


The demosales package can be loaded into SyncroSim as either an empty library or as the **Demo Sales - Basic** library, containing pre-defined datafeeds. The user sets the timespan of the model as well as the number of iterations.

The user also fills in information about current car sales, specifying *Region*, *Item*, *Price*, *Current Min Units Sold*, *Current Max Units Sold*, and *% Annual Sales Increase*.

The user can then run the scenarios to create a sales forecast of hybrid and electric vehicles.
